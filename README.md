Orange Onix 75 Review

School reports company

Help teachers find out test results
String of comma separated values denoting student grades
Report summarising those figures

3 point scoring system:
Green
Amber
Red

Report output should be a String
"Green, Green, Amber, Red, Green"â€©
=>
"Green: 3\nAmber: 1\nRed: 1"

Needs to also count typos etc and add them to an uncounted category

Feedback
-Make use of an input/output table and verify with the user at the top
-Don't let the code get ahead of the test (stick with TDD)
-Keep the old tests instead of modifying them
-Don't add new tests until the existing ones work
